## [0.27.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox/v/0.27.1)

## Updates

- Adds a `Value.Mutate(left, right)` function. This function performs a deep mutable assignment on a value by internally remapping the `right` values on the `left`. Values omitted on the right will also be deleted on the left. This function can be useful scenarios where mutation of data is required without replacing existing reference values. An example of which might be React which tracks reference values to indicate redraw. This function is implemented by way of `ValuePointer`.
