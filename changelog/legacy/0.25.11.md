Updates:

- [286](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox/pull/286) implements a FNV1A-64 non cryptographic hashing function in TypeBox. This function should not be used in place of cryptographic hashing functions, rather it's purpose is to provide relatively fast, hashing mechanism to assist with checks for arrays with uniqueItems constraints, specifically for cases where the array may contains reference values (such as objects, arrays, Dates and Uint8Array). This function is provided via `Value.Hash()` for convenience as the hash may be useful to generate a numeric identifier for values (with some considerations to React array rendering in absence of key or identifier)
