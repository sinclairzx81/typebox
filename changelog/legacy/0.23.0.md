## [0.23.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox/v/0.23.0)

Updates:

- The types `Type.Namespace(...)` and `Type.Ref(...)` are promoted to `Standard`.
- TypeBox now includes an additional type named `TRef<...>` that is returned on calls to `Type.Ref(...)`. The `TRef<...>` includes a new `RefKind` symbol for introspection of the reference type.
- TypeBox now maintains an internal dictionary of all schemas passed that contain an `$id` property. This dictionary is checked whenever a user attempts to reference a type and will throw if attempting to reference a target schema with no `$id`.
- The types `Type.Partial(...)`, `Type.Required(...)`, `Type.Omit()` and `Type.Pick(...)` now support reference types. Note that when using these functions with references, TypeBox will replicate the source schema and apply the necessary modifiers to the replication.
