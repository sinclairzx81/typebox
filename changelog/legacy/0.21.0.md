## [0.21.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox/v/0.21.0)

Updates:

- TypeBox static inference has been updated inline with additional inference constraints added in TypeScript 4.5. All types now include a phantom `_infer` property which contains the inference TS type for a given schema. The type of this property is inferred at the construction of the schema, and referenced directly via `Static<T>`.
- `Type.Box(...)` has been renamed to `Type.Namespace(...)` to draw an analogy with XML's `xmlns` XSD types.
