## [0.22.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox/v/0.22.0)

Updates:

- The type `TSchema` is now expressed as an HKT compatible interface. All types now extend the `TSchema` interface and are themselves also expressed as interfaces. This work was undertaken to explore recursive type aliases in future releases.
- The phantom property `_infer` has been renamed to `$static`. Callers should not interact with this property as it will always be `undefined` and used exclusively for optimizing type inference in TypeScript 4.5 and above.
- TypeBox re-adds the feature to deeply introspect schema properties. This feature was temporarily removed on the `0.21.0` update to resolve deep instantiation errors on TypeScript 4.5.
- The `Type.Box(...)` and `Type.Rec(...)` functions internally rename the property `definitions` to `$defs` inline with JSON schema draft 2019-09 conventions. Reference [here](https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/definitions.html).
