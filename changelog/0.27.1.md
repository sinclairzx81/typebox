## [0.27.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox/v/0.27.1)

## Updates

- Adds a `Value.Mutate(current, next): void` function. This function performs a deep mutable assignment on a value by internally remapping the `next(right)` values on the `current(left)`. Values omitted on the right will also be deleted on the left. This function can be useful instances where mutation of data is required without modification to existing references. An example of which might be React which tracks reference values to signal redraws. This function is implemented by way of `ValuePointer`.
