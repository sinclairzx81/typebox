  - Add Configuration for Corrective Parse | Breaking Change to Parse

## Overview

Version 1.1.0 introduces a behavioral change to `Value.Parse(...)` and `Validator.Parse(...)` where automatic corrective parsing is now disabled by default. This change addresses performance overhead when handling invalid data and prepares the `Value.*` API for future revisions.

This update introduces a validation semantics change and is published under a minor semver version.

## Corrective Parse

In 1.0, a feature referred to as “Corrective Parse” was trialed. This feature meant that for any invalid value passed to Parse, TypeBox would attempt to Convert, Default, and Clean the value, then re-Check it before throwing an assertion. The feature was introduced in 1.0 in an effort to establish a de facto parsing pipeline for TypeBox, but it has since been observed that it incurs significant performance overhead for large invalid values. Additionally, the correction behavior has generally proven surprising to users, and is therefore better expressed as an opt-in feature.

The following shows the changes from 1.0 to 1.1

```typescript
// 1.0 
const A = Value.Parse(Type.Number(), '123') // A = 123

// 1.1
const A = Value.Parse(Type.Number(), '123') // throw! - Expected Number
```

Corrective parsing can be re-enabled by using the `{ correctiveParse: true }` configuration.

```typescript
import { Settings } from 'typebox/system'

// 1.1
Settings.Set({ correctiveParse: true })

const A = Value.Parse(Type.Number(), '123') // A = 123
```
